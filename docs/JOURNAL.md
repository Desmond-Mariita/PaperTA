  - internal review protocol + agent catalog
  - checklist verification script
  - phase report generator
  - GitHub phase-gate CI workflows
- Phase 1 started - Loop 1 (Design) on branch `phase-1-loop-1-design`.
- Phase 1 Loop 1 (Design) completed; contract and checklist frozen after internal and external review remediation.
