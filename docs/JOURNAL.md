- Initialized PaperTA governance scaffold (two-loop workflow, templates, tracking docs).
- Ported high-value governance tooling from MedInsight patterns:
  - internal review protocol + agent catalog
  - checklist verification script
  - phase report generator
  - GitHub phase-gate CI workflows
- Phase 1 started - Loop 1 (Design) on branch `phase-1-loop-1-design`.
- Phase 1 Loop 1 (Design) completed; contract and checklist frozen after internal and external review remediation.
- Phase 1 started - Loop 2 (Build) on branch `phase-1-loop-2-build`.
- Phase 1 Loop 2 (Build) passed gates: internal review PASS, external provenance PASS, checklist PASS (24/24), pytest PASS (13).
- Phase 1 completed end-to-end.
