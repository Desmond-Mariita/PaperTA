# Phase 1 Design External Review Context

Review the following artifacts for completeness, consistency, and implementation risk:

1. `docs/adr/ADR-001-phase1-ingestion-grounded-summary.md`
2. `docs/contracts/PHASE1_RUNTIME_CONTRACT.md`
3. `docs/checklists/PHASE1_ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.yaml`
4. `RULES_OF_ENGAGEMENT.md`

Focus on:

- groundedness and no-guessing invariants
- deterministic behavior guarantees
- checklist coverage for unit/integration/negative test requirements
- missing edge cases that could break Phase 1 implementation
